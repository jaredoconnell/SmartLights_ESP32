# SmartLights ESP32

This is library that works alongside the companion [Android app](https://github.com/jaredoconnell/SmartLights) to control the colors and brightness of LED strips over Bluetooth Low Energy.

This project uses PlatformIO with the Expressif 32 SDK. For a video on how to set this up for Visual Studio Code, see
